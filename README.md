### Purpose: To implement backend functionality to the web-scraper using SQLite database, with CRUD-operations.

### Libraries Needed
#### pip install urllib3
#### pip install selenium
#### pip install BeautifulSoup
#### pip install getpass3
#### pip install regex
#### pip install pynput
#### pip install glob3
#### pip install pandas

### How to run
1. Download the repository to any folder on your device.
2. Open powershell/terminal window and change directories to where the instaScrappy.py is located.
3. Pip install the previously mentioned libraries.
4. Type "python instaScrappy.py" in your terminal/powershell window and then follow the on-screen instructions.

### PLEASE NOTE
#### You MUST first scrape the web before accessing the database, otherwise the program will not work. I am going to try and implement better code changes as time goes on, in addition to adding mroe SQL-queries in the next tutorial.
